# 10x10

The player must fill all 100 squares incrementally with numbers starting at 1 and reaching 100.

Once a number is placed, the next one can go in only a limited amount of possible positions:

* If placing the next number horizontally or vertically, the next number must be two squares away.
* If placing the next number diagonally, the number must be one square away.
